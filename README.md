# About Our Project
Crate Diggers is an e-commerce site developed by an inspired programming team for the music enthusiasts. Our objective is to bring that feeling of browsing in a brick and mortar to the digital medium for those looking to recapture that excitement of treasure hunting and discovery. Get in, checkout, and come back for more!

# How It Works
Behind the hood, we've produced a full stack react application built using SQL database queries to store persistent data concurrently with express server routes and middleware to manipulate, authenticate, and retrieve data in a meaningful way. Our backend restricts certain actions using authorization middleware that checks for JWT hash tampering before allowing actions to proceed. Alongside this, we offer a safe and secure ecommerce checkout system, through the stripe library that has built in encryption and authentication methods. Utilizing flex box and media queries, we've applied our mobile first design philosophy to build an application that incorporates an adaptable and scalable user interface. As developers, we designed an intuitive browsing experience by sorting our products into digestible sections based on genres in a carousel format using the framer-motion library.
